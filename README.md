# Lego Mosaic Generator

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A Python application with a graphical user interface that converts images into Lego mosaic designs. The application pixelizes an image and determines the exact Lego bricks needed to construct the mosaic.

![Application Screenshot](screenshots/screenshot.png)

## Features

- Load any standard image file (JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF)
- Automatically resize the image to fit within 30 inches for Lego construction
- Convert each pixel to the closest available Lego brick color
- Display both original and mosaic images
- Calculate the exact number of Lego bricks needed by color
- Show the physical dimensions of the final mosaic
- Generate detailed building instructions with 10x10 grid sections

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt):
  - Pillow (PIL)
  - tkinter
  - pandas
  - openpyxl
  - numpy

## Installation

### Option 1: Run from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lego-mosaic-generator.git
   cd lego-mosaic-generator
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python lego_mosaic_generator.py
   ```

### Option 2: Standalone Executable

For users who don't want to install Python or dependencies:

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/lego-mosaic-generator/releases) page.
2. Extract the zip file
3. Run `Lego Mosaic Generator.exe` (Windows) or `Lego Mosaic Generator` (Mac/Linux)

### Building the Executable Yourself

1. Ensure you have Python installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Run the build script:
   - On Windows: Double-click `build.bat` or run it from command prompt
   - On Mac/Linux: 
     ```bash
     chmod +x build.sh
     ./build.sh
     ```
4. The executable will be created in the `Lego_Mosaic_Generator_Release` folder

## Usage

1. Launch the application from source or using the executable
2. Click the "Browse" button to select an image
3. Click "Generate Mosaic" to process the image
4. Review the mosaic preview and brick requirements
5. Click "Download Building Instructions" to create and save detailed building instructions
6. The information provided can be used to purchase the required Lego bricks

## Building Instructions

The application can generate comprehensive building instructions for your Lego mosaic:

1. After generating a mosaic, click the "Download Building Instructions" button
2. Select a folder to save the instructions
3. The application will create:
   - A full overview image with a grid system
   - Detailed images for each 10x10 section with coordinates
   - A summary text file with all brick requirements and building guidance
4. The instructions are divided into manageable 10x10 sections (labeled A1, A2, B1, etc.)
5. Each brick's position is clearly marked with coordinates
6. Follow the instructions to build your mosaic one section at a time

## How It Works

1. The application loads an image file
2. It calculates the proper resize factor to ensure the longest side will be no more than 30 inches when constructed with Lego bricks (each Lego 1x1 brick is 0.315 inches wide)
3. The image is resized to create a pixelated version
4. For each pixel, the application finds the closest matching Lego color from the "Lego Colors.xlsx" database
5. The application counts the number of bricks needed for each color
6. The resulting mosaic is displayed alongside the original image, with detailed information about brick requirements
7. When requested, detailed building instructions are generated by dividing the mosaic into 10x10 grids

## Customization

- The `MAX_LENGTH` constant (default: 30 inches) can be modified to adjust the maximum physical size of the mosaic
- The `LEGO_WIDTH` constant (default: 0.314961 inches) represents the physical width of a 1x1 Lego brick
- The `GRID_SIZE` constant (default: 10) controls the size of instruction grid sections

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request. See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines.

## Future Enhancements

- Export functionality to save the mosaic design
- Support for different brick sizes (2x2, 2x4, etc.)
- Cost estimation for the required bricks
- Integration with online Lego stores
- Brick usage optimization
- Interactive building instructions
